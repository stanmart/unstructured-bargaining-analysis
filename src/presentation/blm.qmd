# Introduction

## Motivation

::: {.fragment}
- Much work on bargaining in experimental economics (understatement)
:::
::: {.fragment}
- Much less work on **free-form bargaining** between more than two players
  - especially between **more than two players**
:::
::: {.fragment}
- The **one indispensable player / multiple small players** setting has real-world relevance
  - Wage bargaining
  - An inventor with an idea and multiple investors
  - A band, where one member owns the PA system
:::

## Research question

::: {.fragment}
- Problem: non-cooperative game theory cannot provide predictions without structure
  - E.g. timing of the game, who makes the offers
  - NCGT solution is alternating offer games, but a lot depends on minor details [@hart1996bargaining]
:::

::: {.highlight-block .idea .fragment}
- Intuitive expectation about how substitutabililty affects bargaining power
- Cooperative game theory concepts might be a viable alternative
:::

## Literature

::: {.smaller}
- Early unstructured bargaining papers (1950s-1990s):  
  - @Kalischetal1952, @Maschler1965, @NydeggerOwen1974, @RapoportKahan1976, **@MurnighanRoth1977**, @MurnighanRoth1978, @Micheneretal1979, @MichenerPotter1981, **@LeopoldWildburger1992** 
    - Free-form bargaining is face-to-face, different experimental standards
- Most more recent bargaining papers are on bilateral and structured/semi-structured bargaining
  - E.g. @Isonietal2014, @KaragözoğluRiedl2015, @EmbreyFrechetteLehrer2015, @MitsutsuneTakanori2014
  - Free-form bargaining: @LuhanPoulsenRoos2019, @Schwaninger2022, @Galeottietal2018, @HossainLyonsSiow2020, **@NavarroVeszteg2020**, @Diermeieretal2008
    - Almost all bilateral 
  - Bargaining with at least three players: @MonteroSeftonZhang2008, @TremewanVanberg2016, **@ShinodaFunaki2022**
    - Structured/semi-structured bargaining 
- Fairness views:

# Game and solution concepts

## The game

- Players: $N = \{A, B_1, B_2\}$
- Value function:
  - No one can create any value alone: $v(\{A\}) = v(\{B_i\}) = 0$
  - Player $A$ is indispensable: $v(\{B_1, B_2\}) = 0$
  - Small players contribute to the value: $v(\{A, B_i\}) = Y \in [0, 100]$
  - The more small players the better: $v(\{A, B_1, B_2\}) = 100$
- How to divide the value between the players?

## Shapley value

- Each players gets their average marginal contribution
  - Fairness based motivation
- Appealing characterization
  - Efficient: whole pie is distributed
  - Symmetric: identical (from the pov of $v$) players should get the same payoff
  - Dummy player property: players contributing nothing get nothing
  - Linearity (across games)
- Useful properties
  - Always exists
  - Always unique

## Core

- Excess: what a coalition gets vs what it could achieve on its own
- The set of payoff vectors such that excess is non-negative for all coalitions
  - Stability-based concept
  - Similar idea to the Nash equilibrium, but for multi-player deviations
- Very intuitive and plausible, but
  - Can be empty (existence not guaranteed)
  - Can be multi-valued (uniqueness not guaranteed)

## Nucleolus

- Maximizes the smallest excess across coalitions
  - if the core is non-empty, the nucleolus is in the core
  - Mix of stability and fairness
- Useful properties
  - Always exists
  - Always unique
- Can be thought of as a way to mix the stability-based intuition behind the core with useful properties of the Shapley value

## In our game

# Experimental design 

## General structure

- Conducted in the BLU lab (May 2024)
  - 4 treatments/sessions: $Y=10$, $Y=30$, $Y=90$, dummy player
  - 144 subjects in total (36 subjects per session) 
- Timing: 
  - Instructions with comprehension checks
  - Slider task
  - Trial round + 5 bargaining rounds (5 minutes each)
  - Survey (demographics, reasoning, axioms)
- Payment: 
  - Conversion: 1 point = 0.6CHF
  - Subjects are paid their average payoff across all rounds + show-up fee

## Role and group assignment

- Player roles are assigned stochastically based on players' performance in the slider task
  - the better they perform, the higher the likelihood of becoming Player A
- Stranger matching for bargaining groups each round
  - no set of subjects is matched twice
- Split each session into 6 matching groups (à 6 players) in order to account for dependence between rounds in the analysis
  - Bargaining groups are only redrawn within matching groups

## Bargaining

- Bargaining via public chat 
- Interface for submitting proposals and current acceptances to facilitate bargaining
- Free-form bargaining: 
  - Unlimited number of proposals 
  - No restrictions on the order of proposals and acceptances 
  - Acceptances are not binding and can be changed any time
- At the end of each bargaining round: 
  - Current acceptances are taken as final decisions
  - A proposal is successful only if all members of a coalition agree on it

:::

- Qualitatively agrees with the nucleolus and disagrees with SV
- Quantitatively closer to SV in $Y=90$ treatment (cf. plots)

:::{.column width="35%" .smaller}
- In the $Y=90$ treatment, A only achieves significantly higher than ES by excluding one small player
  - Not efficient
  - Why doesn't the excluded player seem to want the remaining 10 points
- The outcomes are still not stable
  - excluded player could make a counter-offer

## Chat logs

- Have around 6000 chat messages in total
  - Participants interacted intensively over chat
  - Quality is rather messy (typos, slang, etc.)
- What to do with it?
  - Find words that are relatively more prevalent depending on the outcome
  - Classify messages into categories (e.g. fairness-related, small talk, etc.) 
  - Can also learn things like people's understanding of the game
- In general, would probably need *much* more data for proper NLP analysis


# Conclusions

## What we did

- **Free-form bargaining** is important to understand
  - More realistic than strictly controlled designs
  - NCGT have trouble describing it → check if CGT is predictive
- Players could bargain for 5 minutes **without any binding actions**
  - An interface for proposing and accepting allocations
  - Group-level unrestricted **chat**
- **Vary the necessity of including both small players** between treatments

## Main takeaways

- Lots of **equal splits** in all treatments
- **Nucleolus** gives **qualitatively correct** predictions, Shapley value does not
  - People might think in terms of **stability** and profitable deviations
- **Both fail quantitatively**, especially when the big player has lots of bargaining power
  - SV seems to be closer in the $Y=90$ case for non-equal splits
- People's **stated preferences** (axiom survey) **and actions disagree**
  - What would happen if these axioms were mentioned before the bargaining?

## Future research

- **Chat logs** are useful even in lieu of proper analysis
  - Going through them reveals a lot about players' understanding of the game
- We have a **rich dataset** (real time actions)
  - Good for exploratory analysis and to inform study design in the future
  - Not sure what aspects to look into more deeply – **ideas?**
- Differences between matching groups
  - Maybe just player heterogeneity
  - Or norms / reference values determined in the first couple of rounds?
