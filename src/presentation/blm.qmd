# Solution concepts

## The game

- Players: $N = \{A, B_1, B_2\}$
- Value function:
  - No one can create any value alone: $v(\{A\}) = v(\{B_i\}) = 0$
  - Player $A$ is indispensable: $v(\{B_1, B_2\}) = 0$
  - Small players contribute to the value: $v(\{A, B_i\}) = Y \in [0, 100]$
  - The more small players the better: $v(\{A, B_1, B_2\}) = 100$
- How to divide the value between the players?

## Core

- The set of payoff vectors such that no sub-coalition has a larger value than the sum of their payoffs
  - Stability-based concept
  - Similar idea to the Nash equilibrium, but for multi-player deviations
- Very intuitive and plausible, but
  - Can be empty (existence not guaranteed)
  - Can be multi-valued (uniqueness not guaranteed)

## Nucleolus

- Maximizes the smallest excess (sum of payoffs minus value) across coalitions
  - Not as nice intuition as for the core, but...
  - if the core is non-empty, the nucleolus is in the core
- Useful properties
  - Always exists
  - Always unique
- Can be thought of as a way to mix the stability-based intuition behind the core with useful properties

## Shapley value

- Each players gets their average marginal contribution
  - Fairness based motivation
- Appealing characterization
  - Efficient: whole pie is distributed
  - Symmetric: identical (from the pov of $v$) players should get the same payoff
  - Dummy player property: players contributing nothing get nothing
  - Linearity (across games)
- Useful properties
  - Always exists
  - Always unique
