# Introduction

## Motivation

::: {.fragment}
- Much work on bargaining in experimental economics (understatement)
:::
::: {.fragment}
- Much less work on **free-form bargaining**
  - especially between **more than two players**
:::
::: {.fragment}
- The **one indispensable player / multiple small players** setting has real-world relevance
  - Wage bargaining
  - An inventor with an idea and multiple investors
  - A band, where one member owns the PA system
:::

::: {.notes}
 - Need some asymmetry for interesting bargaining outcomes
 - One player being indispensable is
   - Natural
   - Maximally asymmetrix → stronger effect
:::

## Research question

::: {.fragment}
- Problem: non-cooperative game theory cannot provide predictions without structure
  - E.g. timing of the game, who makes the offers
  - NCGT solution is alternating offer games, but a lot depends on minor details [@hart1996bargaining]
:::

::: {.highlight-block .fragment}
- How does bargaining power affect bargaining outcomes?
- How well do cooperative game theory solution concepts describe the outcomes?
:::

::: {.notes}
- Bargaining power ~ how important it is to have all small players on board (see later)
:::

## What we do

::: {.fragment}
- **Free-form bargaining between three players**
  - Almost no structure
  - Group-level unrestricted **chat**
  - An interface for proposing and accepting allocations
  - No binding decision until the very last second
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Vary the bargaining power of the indispensable player
  - How important it is to have all small players on board
:::

::: {.fragment}
- We test, whether:
  - Outcomes vary as we would expect, based on bargaining power
  - Certain CGT solution concepts provide good predictions
:::

::: {.notes}
- Everything before the final seconds is cheap talk
- What the big player and one small player can achieve on their own
- Also, lots of data for exploratory analysis
:::

## Literature
:::: {.smaller}
::: {.fragment}
- Early unstructured bargaining papers (1950s-1990s):  
  - E.g. @Kalischetal1952, @Maschler1965, @NydeggerOwen1974, @RapoportKahan1976, **@MurnighanRoth1977**, @MurnighanRoth1978, @Micheneretal1979, @MichenerPotter1981, **@LeopoldWildburger1992** 
  - Face to face bargaining, different experimental standards
:::
::: {.fragment}
- Free-form bargaining
  - E.g. @Galeottietal2018, @HossainLyonsSiow2020, **@NavarroVeszteg2020**
  - Almost always bilateral
:::
::: {.fragment}
- Multi-lateral bargaining
  - E.g. @MonteroSeftonZhang2008, @MitsutsuneTakanori2014, @TremewanVanberg2016, @chessa2023experiment, **@ShinodaFunaki2022**
  - Structured or semi-structured
:::
::: {.fragment}
- Fairness views in bargaining
  - E.g. @LuhanPoulsenRoos2019, @Schwaninger2022, **@ClippelRozen2022**
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
- @MurnighanRoth1977: shoes game ($Y=0$); series of papers: information and communication structure are important
- @LeopoldWildburger1992: face to face, very long rounds, convex comb. of N + ES or SV + ES
- @NavarroVeszteg2020: bilateral, chat, tests axioms (rejets scale invariance)
- @ShinodaFunaki2022: chat in some treatments, semi-unstructured; how existence of core affects outcomes
- @ClippelRozen2022: outside party assigns payoffs, SV + ES

# Game and solution concepts

## The game

::: {.fragment}
- **Players**: $N = \{A, B_1, B_2\}$
:::
::: {.fragment}
- **Value function**: $v: 2^N \to \mathbb{R}$
  - No one can create any value alone: $v(\{A\}) = v(\{B_i\}) = 0$
  - Player $A$ is indispensable: $v(\{B_1, B_2\}) = 0$
  - Small players contribute to the value: $v(\{A, B_i\}) = Y \in [0, 100]$
  - The more small players the better: $v(\{A, B_1, B_2\}) = 100$
:::

::: {.highlight-block .fragment}
How to divide the value between the players?
:::

::: {.notes}
- No need to define strategy spaces, only players pllus payoffs
- It "makes sense" for the grand coalition to form (but wait for results)
:::

## Shapley value

::: {.fragment}
- Each players gets their **average marginal contribution**
  - Fairness based motivation
:::
::: {.fragment}
- Appealing characterization
  - Efficient: whole pie is distributed
  - Symmetric: identical (from the pov of $v$) players should get the same payoff
  - Dummy player property: players contributing nothing get nothing
  - Linearity (across games)
:::
::: {.fragment}
- Useful properties
  - Always exists
  - Always unique
:::

## Core

::: {.fragment}
- Excess: what a coalition gets vs what it could achieve on its own
:::
::: {.fragment}
- The set of payoff vectors such that excess is non-negative for all coalitions
  - **No coalition has an incentive to deviate**
  - Stability-based concept
  - Similar idea to the Nash equilibrium, but for multi-player deviations
:::
::: {.fragment}
- Very intuitive and plausible, but
  - Can be empty (existence not guaranteed)
  - Can be multi-valued (uniqueness not guaranteed)
:::

## Nucleolus

::: {.fragment}
- **Maximizes the smallest excess** across coalitions
  - if the core is non-empty, the nucleolus is in the core
  - Mix of stability and fairness
:::
::: {.fragment}
- Useful properties
  - Always exists
  - Always unique
:::
::: {.fragment}
- Can be thought of as a way to mix the stability-based intuition behind the core with useful properties of the Shapley value
:::

## In our game
![](/out/figures/values_theory.svg)

::: {.notes}
- Both are increasing in Y
  - Nucleolus is flat for low Y (no real bargaiing power)
  - SV predictions are less extreme
- Core would contain ES for Y < 67
:::

# Experimental design 

## General structure

::: {.fragment}
- Conducted in the BLU lab (May 2024)
  - **4 treatments/sessions**: $Y=10$, $Y=30$, $Y=90$, dummy player
  - **144 subjects** in total (36 subjects per session) 
:::
::: {.fragment}
- Timing: 
  - Instructions with comprehension checks
  - Slider task
  - Trial round + 5 bargaining rounds (5 minutes each)
  - Survey (demographics, reasoning, axioms)
:::
::: {.fragment}
- Average payoff across all rounds + show-up fee
  - Conversion: 1 point = CHF 0.6
:::

::: {.notes}
- Have to solve tasks on a mock interface to proceed
- Slider task to make the bargaining position feel earned
- Slider task performance not disclosed
:::

## Role and group assignment

::: {.fragment}
- **Player roles** are assigned stochastically **based on players' performance in the slider task**
  - the better they perform, the higher the likelihood of becoming Player A
:::
::: {.fragment}
- **Stranger matching** for bargaining groups each round
  - no set of subjects is matched twice
:::
::: {.fragment}
- Split each session into **6 matching groups** (à 6 players) in order to account for dependence between rounds in the analysis
  - Bargaining groups are only redrawn within matching groups
:::

::: {.notes}
- Power-validity tradeoff: players could meet again, but
  - Not in the exact same constellation
  - Players are anonymous (although some players reveal themselves...)
:::

## Bargaining

::: {.fragment}
- Bargaining via **public chat** and interface for submitting **proposals** and current **acceptances**
:::
::: {.fragment}
- Free-form bargaining: 
  - Unlimited number of proposals 
  - No restrictions on the order of proposals and acceptances 
  - Acceptances are **not binding** and can be changed any time
:::
::: {.fragment}
- At the end of each bargaining round: 
  - Current acceptances are taken as final decisions
  - **A proposal is successful only if all members of a coalition agree on it**
:::

# Main results

## Payoffs – aggregate
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="65%"}
![](/out/figures/payoff_average.svg){width=100% height=100%}
:::

:::{.column width="35%" .smaller}
- Dummy player gets something
- $Y=10$ and $Y=30$ treatments look similar
- Player A gets more in $Y=30$ treatment
- Nucleolus better in terms of 'shape' but worse in terms of 'distance'
:::

::::

## Payoff of Player A – regression

::: {.smaller}
```{python}
import pickle
from statsmodels.iolib.summary2 import summary_col

with open("out/analysis/regression.pkl", "rb") as reg:
    regression_continuous = pickle.load(reg)
with open("out/analysis/regression_dummies.pkl", "rb") as reg:
    regression_dummies = pickle.load(reg)

table = summary_col(
    [regression_continuous, regression_dummies],
    stars=True,
    float_format="%.2f",
    model_names=["Model cont.", "Model ind."],
    include_r2=False,
    info_dict={"N": lambda reg: f"{int(reg.nobs):d}"}

table.extra_txt[0] = "Matching-group-level clustered standard errors in parentheses."
table
```

## Payoffs – a deeper look
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="65%"}
![](/out/figures/payoff_scatterplot.svg){width=100% height=100%}
:::

:::{.column width="35%" .smaller}
- In all treatments, equal(ish) split is a frequent outcome
  - Even in the dummy player treatment!
- $Y=10$ and $Y=30$ treatments still look similar
- In the $Y=90$ treatment, A can occasionally do much better
:::

::::

## Payoff of Player A – non-parametrics

Mann-Whitney test comparing Player A's payoff across groups

::: {.smaller}
```{python}
import json
import pandas as pd

with open("out/analysis/mann_whitney.json", "r") as mw:
    mw_results = json.load(mw)

table = pd.DataFrame.from_records(mw_results).T
table = table.rename(columns={
    "statistic": "U statistic",
    "pvalue": "p-value",
})
table = table.rename(
    index=lambda s: " < ".join(f"[Y = {t}]" for t in s.split("-"))
)
table

```

:::

- Qualitatively agrees with the nucleolus and disagrees with SV
- Quantitatively closer to SV in $Y=90$ treatment (cf. plots)

# Exploratory observations

::: {.notes}
- Will skip quite a lot here
- Let us know which of these are interesting
:::

## Payoffs by coordination outcomes

::: {.column width="65%"}
![](/out/figures/payoff_by_agreement_type.svg){width=100% height=100%}
:::

:::{.column width="35%" .smaller}
- In the $Y=90$ treatment, A only achieves significantly higher than ES by excluding one small player
  - Not efficient
  - Why doesn't the excluded player seem to want the remaining 10 points
- The outcomes are still not stable
  - excluded player could make a counter-offer

# Real-time interactions {.unlisted .unnumbered}

## Time of proposing and accepting final allocation
![](/out/figures/timing_until_decision.svg)

::: {.smaller}
- Most final allocations are proposed within the first minute
:::

## Time of accepting final allocation
![](/out/figures/timing_until_agreement_scatterplot.svg)

::: {.smaller}
- Most agreement times are well before the end of the bargaining time
- In the $Y=90$ treatment, partial agreements come later
- Otherwise, agreement times are broadly similar across the main treatments
:::

## Chat logs

- Have around 6000 chat messages in total
  - Participants interacted intensively over chat
  - Quality is rather messy (typos, slang, etc.)
- What to do with it?
  - Find words that are relatively more prevalent depending on the outcome
  - Classify messages into categories (e.g. fairness-related, small talk, etc.) 
  - Can also learn things like people's understanding of the game
- In general, would probably need *much* more data for proper NLP analysis

# Conclusions

## What we did

::: {.fragment}
- **Free-form bargaining** is important to understand
  - More realistic than strictly controlled designs
  - NCGT have trouble describing it → check if CGT is predictive
:::
::: {.fragment}
- Players could bargain for 5 minutes **without any binding actions**
  - An interface for proposing and accepting allocations
  - Group-level unrestricted **chat**
:::
::: {.fragment}
- **Vary the necessity of including both small players** between treatments
:::

::: {.notes}
- Our experimental setup is a novel way to do multilateral, free form bargaining
  - Might be useful for other studies, as well
:::

## Main takeaways

::: {.fragment}
- Lots of **equal splits** in all treatments
:::
::: {.fragment}
- **Nucleolus** gives **qualitatively correct** predictions
  - People might think in terms of **stability** and profitable deviations
:::
::: {.fragment}
- **Both fail quantitatively**, especially when the big player has lots of bargaining power
  - SV seems to be closer in the $Y=90$ case for non-equal splits
:::
::: {.fragment}
- People's **stated preferences** (axiom survey) **and actions disagree**
:::

::: {.notes}
- In general, considerable heterogeneity in outcomes
  - Heterogeneity in fairness concepts?
:::

## Future research

::: {.fragment}
- **Chat logs** are useful even in lieu of proper analysis
  - Going through them reveals a lot about players' understanding of the game
:::
::: {.fragment}
- We have a **rich dataset** (real time actions)
  - Good for exploratory analysis and to inform study design in the future
  - Not sure what aspects to look into more deeply – **ideas?**
:::
::: {.fragment}
- Differences between matching groups
  - Maybe just player heterogeneity
  - Or norms / reference values determined in the first couple of rounds?
:::

::: {.notes}
- Any ideas on what to dig deeper into?
