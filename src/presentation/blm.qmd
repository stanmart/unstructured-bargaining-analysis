# Introduction

## Literature
[see @ShapleyLloydetal1953]

- early unstructured bargaining papers (1950s-1990s): @Kalischetal1952, @Maschler1965, @NydeggerOwen1974, @RapoportKahan1976, **@MurnighanRoth1977**, @MurnighanRoth1978, @Micheneretal1979, @MichenerPotter1981, **@LeopoldWildburger1992**
  - mostly face-to-face bargaining 
- free-form bargaining: 
- multiplayer bargaining

# Game and solution concepts

## The game

- Players: $N = \{A, B_1, B_2\}$
- Value function:
  - No one can create any value alone: $v(\{A\}) = v(\{B_i\}) = 0$
  - Player $A$ is indispensable: $v(\{B_1, B_2\}) = 0$
  - Small players contribute to the value: $v(\{A, B_i\}) = Y \in [0, 100]$
  - The more small players the better: $v(\{A, B_1, B_2\}) = 100$
- How to divide the value between the players?

## Core

- The set of payoff vectors such that no sub-coalition has a larger value than the sum of their payoffs
  - Stability-based concept
  - Similar idea to the Nash equilibrium, but for multi-player deviations
- Very intuitive and plausible, but
  - Can be empty (existence not guaranteed)
  - Can be multi-valued (uniqueness not guaranteed)

## Nucleolus

- Maximizes the smallest excess (sum of payoffs minus value) across coalitions
  - Not as nice intuition as for the core, but...
  - if the core is non-empty, the nucleolus is in the core
- Useful properties
  - Always exists
  - Always unique
- Can be thought of as a way to mix the stability-based intuition behind the core with useful properties

## Shapley value

- Each players gets their average marginal contribution
  - Fairness based motivation
- Appealing characterization
  - Efficient: whole pie is distributed
  - Symmetric: identical (from the pov of $v$) players should get the same payoff
  - Dummy player property: players contributing nothing get nothing
  - Linearity (across games)
- Useful properties
  - Always exists
  - Always unique

# Experimental design 

## General structure

- 4 treatments: $Y=10$, $Y=30$, $Y=90$, dummy player
- 4 experiment sessions (one treatment per session)
- 144 subjects in total (36 subjects per session) 
- Conducted in the BLU lab (May 2024)
- Timing: 
  - Instructions with comprehension checks
  - Slider task
  - Trial round + 5 bargaining rounds (5 minutes each)
  - Survey (demographics, reasoning, axioms)
- Payment: 
  - Conversion: 1 point = 0.6CHF
  - Subjects are paid their average payoff across all rounds + show-up fee

## Role and group assignment

- Player roles are assigned stochastically based on players' performance in the slider task
  - the better they perform, the higher the likelihood of becoming Player A
- Stranger matching for bargaining groups each round
  - no set of subjects is matched twice
- Split each session into 6 matching groups (à 6 players) in order to account for dependence between rounds in the analysis
  - Bargaining groups are only redrawn within matching groups

## Bargaining

- Bargaining via public chat 
- Interface for submitting proposals and current acceptances to facilitate bargaining
- Free-form bargaining: 
  - Unlimited number of proposals 
  - No restrictions on the order of proposals and acceptances 
  - Acceptances are not binding and can be changed any time
- At the end of each bargaining round: 
  - Current acceptances are taken as final decisions
  - A proposal is successful only if all members of a coalition agree on it

- Dummy player gets something
- $Y=10$ and $Y=30$ treatments look similar
- Player A gets more in $Y=30$ treatment
- Nucleolus better in terms of 'shape' but worse in terms of 'distance'

- In all treatments, equal(ish) split is a frequent outcome
  - Even in the dummy player treatment!
- $Y=10$ and $Y=30$ treatments still look similar
- In the $Y=90$ treatment, A can occasionally do much better

# Exploratory observations

- Qualitatively agrees with the nucleolus and disagrees with SV
- Quantitatively disagrees with both (cf. plots)

:::{.column width="35%" .smaller}
- In the $Y=90$ treatment, A only achieves significantly higher than ES by excluding one small player
  - Not efficient
  - Why doesn't the excluded player seem to want the remaining 10 points
- The outcomes are still not stable
  - excluded player could make a counter-offer

- Most agreement times are well before the end of the bargaining time
- In the $Y=90$ treatment, partial agreements come later
